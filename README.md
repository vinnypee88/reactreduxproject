# Reddit Client Project

This is a front end project incorporating react and redux technologies. 

## Description

The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API

## Current Work 

The initial phase will involve creating the parent components that will render the header, main body and the nav. 
Due to the simplicity of the page, a digital wireframe will not be created for particular project at this time. 
* Create header Component
* Create main body component
* Create the nav component. 
* Make the page responsive using CSS. 

## Future Work 

* Create child components of 3 parent components, header, main and nav. 
* Header will have a search bar for users to filter and search for posts
* Nav will have predifined topics that users will be able to effortlessly navigate to. 
* Main body will contain individual posts which will contain comments, images etc. 
* The components will fetch data from the Reddit API and this will be stored in the store.js file using redux technologies. 

## Testing 
At this stage, this project will not be test driven.
Tests will be written at a later stage
